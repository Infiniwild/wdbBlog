A simple blog app -- Built for the Web Developer Bootcamp. 

Built on a **MEN** stack (no React or Angular), utilizing RESTful architecture. Used as a show-off piece for my portfolio.

## Currently used NPM modules

- express
- mongoose
- body-parser
- method-override

## Frameworks

- bulma.io

## 0.7.0 Review

After putting together the full set of RESTful routes, I'm going to review the course material that would have led up to this point. My intent is to determine my overall success. I'm sure there's some parts that I might have completely missed. The *sanitize* module is unimplimented at this point, I understand what it is used for but will rely on the course to show how it's done. 

### Post course

- Revisit form fiends names. use format `name="blog[title]"` rather than the old `name="title"`. This will allow the form data to be pulled directly into the database, rather than having an intermediary object.
